This is very simple-minded dynamic programming code to find minimal
circuits for all boolean functions of n variables. Only use it for
n<=4. :P

To generate a file of minimal circuits just run =(save-mincircuits n)=
and the file =mincircuits#.txt= will be produced with =#= replaced by =n=.
If you try a /huge/ value of =n=, say 5 or more, then you may want to ad
an optional maximal circuit complexity to bound the search. In that
case use =(save-mincircuits n :complexity bound)=.

The search procedure is fairly general. If you want to use different
logic gates, take a look at the code for =mincircuits= and see how the
=and=, =or= and =not= gates are implemented. It is easy to modify that
function to use your preferred gates or, for example, to add constant
1 and constant 0 wires.
